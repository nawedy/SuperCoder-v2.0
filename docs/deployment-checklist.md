- [ ] S3 buckets are configured
- [ ] ECR repositories are ready
- [ ] EKS cluster is provisioned
- [ ] Database resources are configured
- [ ] Network and security groups are properly set up
- [ ] SSL certificates are obtained and configured
- [ ] DNS entries are prepared
- [ ] CloudFront distributions are configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Monitoring systems are ready
- [ ] GCP project access verified
- [ ] Required IAM roles and permissions configured
- [ ] Cloud Storage buckets are configured
- [ ] Container Registry (GCR) is set up
- [ ] GKE cluster is provisioned
- [ ] Firestore database is configured
- [ ] VPC network and security policies are properly set up
- [ ] SSL certificates are obtained and configured with GCP Certificate Manager
- [ ] DNS entries are prepared with Cloud DNS
- [ ] Cloud CDN is configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging are set up

## Deployment Process

### 1. Preparation Phase

- [ ] Create a deployment ticket in project management system
- [ ] Schedule deployment window with all stakeholders
- [ ] Notify users of upcoming deployment (if applicable)
- [ ] Update status page to indicate upcoming maintenance
- [ ] Perform database backup
- [ ] Create deployment branch from release candidate
- [ ] Tag release version in source control

### 2. Deployment Execution

- [ ] Execute `scripts/deploy.sh` script with appropriate environment
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress
- [ ] Verify infrastructure resources are created correctly
- [ ] Verify application deployment is successful
- [ ] Verify database migrations are applied
- [ ] Check logs for any errors or warnings

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Run automated smoke tests
- [ ] Verify critical paths manually
- [ ] Check monitoring dashboards for any issues
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are functioning correctly
- [ ] Verify metrics are being collected
- [ ] Verify logging is working
- [ ] Test alerting system
- [ ] Verify performance meets requirements
- [ ] Confirm content delivery via CDN (if applicable)

### 4. Post-Deployment Actions

- [ ] Update status page to indicate completed maintenance
- [ ] Send deployment confirmation to stakeholders
- [ ] Update documentation with deployment details
- [ ] Tag production deployment in source control
- [ ] Update knowledge base with any lessons learned
- [ ] Schedule post-deployment review meeting

## Rollback Procedure

### Rollback Triggers

- [ ] Critical bug affecting more than 5% of users
- [ ] Security vulnerability is discovered
- [ ] Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Data integrity issues
- [ ] Compliance violations

### Rollback Process

- [ ] Make rollback decision based on severity assessment
- [ ] Execute rollback script: `scripts/deploy.sh --env {environment} --version {previous-version}`
- [ ] Verify rollback is successful
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of rollback
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Document rollback reason and follow-up actions

## Environment-Specific Considerations

### Development Environment

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically
- [ ] Developers are notified of deployment status
- [ ] Development database migrations are idempotent

### Staging Environment

- [ ] Staging environment mirrors production configuration
- [ ] All integration tests run in staging before production
- [ ] Performance testing is conducted in staging
- [ ] UAT is performed in staging

### Production Environment

- [ ] Deployment is performed during scheduled maintenance window
- [ ] Additional approvals are required for production deployment
- [ ] Database backups are created before deployment
- [ ] Traffic is gradually shifted to new version
- [ ] Monitoring is increased during deployment window

## Security Considerations

### Encryption and Data Protection
- [ ] Cloud Storage buckets have encryption enabled using KMS keys
- [ ] Firestore database has encryption at rest enabled
- [ ] Secrets are stored in Secret Manager with appropriate access controls
- [ ] Encryption in transit is enforced using TLS/SSL for all communications
- [ ] Data classification policy is applied to all resources

### Access Control and Identity Management
- [ ] IAM policies follow the principle of least privilege
- [ ] Service accounts are used with minimal required permissions
- [ ] MFA is enabled for all human users with GCP access
- [ ] User access is regularly audited and reviewed
- [ ] Workload Identity is used for GKE pods to access GCP services

### Network Security
- [ ] VPC Service Controls are implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Firewalls are configured to restrict unnecessary access
- [ ] Only required ports and protocols are exposed
- [ ] Web Application Firewall (Cloud Armor) is enabled for ingress protection
- [ ] Network policies are applied to restrict pod-to-pod communication in GKE

### Compliance and Auditing
- [ ] Audit logging is enabled for all GCP services
- [ ] Log retention policies are configured according to compliance requirements
- [ ] Cloud Security Command Center is enabled for threat detection
- [ ] Security Health Analytics is configured to identify misconfigurations
- [ ] Regular security scans are scheduled for container images

### Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
- [ ] Database backup schedule is configured
- [ ] Regional resources are used for high availability
- [ ] Recovery procedures are documented and tested
- [ ] Point-in-time recovery is enabled for critical data
